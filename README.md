# SpeedTracking
(project was recently moved from BitBucket, to its final resting place, github)


Simple speed tracker implemented in python, initialize a known distance in the frame and 
the program calculates the speed of objects through that section.

Accurate to +- .5 mph.

# Future:
I am looking to this summer implementing a 'distance from camera' model to then be able to calculate speed without setting a known distance while still using a single camera.
